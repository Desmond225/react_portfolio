            <h1>Hard work & passion</h1>
            <p>Hi there, I'm Desmond - a former physical therapist, turned web developer in 2018. As a firm believer in hard work in order to achieve success, I've indulged myself in the phenomenon of the 10000 hour rule, based on deliberate practice. 
                After logging over 5000 hours in golf, I felt like programming would fit perfectly as a 'second chapter'. This has been the foundation for my career switch. 
                What's my current progress? 3600 hours, even though this number increases so quickly it's probably a little bit more by the time you read this. ;-)
            </p>
