               <p>based on deliberate practice.</p>
            <p>After logging over 5000 hours in golf, I felt like programming would fit perfectly as a 'second chapter'.</p>
            <p>This has been the foundation for my career switch. 
                What's my current progress? 3600 hours, </p>
                <p>even though this number increases so quickly it's probably a little bit more by the time you read this. ;-)
